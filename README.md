# Simon Game

A simple Simon game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game tests and improves memory by challenging players to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors.

# How to Play

The game starts by flashing a color in the sequence.

The player must click the colors in the correct order.

With each correct sequence, the game adds a new color to the pattern.

If the player clicks the wrong color, the game resets and starts over.

Try to achieve the highest sequence possible!
